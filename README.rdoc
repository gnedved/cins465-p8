This repository contains the code necessary to host a website created for my CINS 465 Web Programming Fundamentals class.
Along with all the code contained in this repository, one needs a server to host the website and all the necessary downloads to
run a rails website.

This project uses the following:

* Ruby version 2.1.0

* Rails version 4

* Rmaggick

* CarrierWave

* Devise

* Bootstrap 2.3.2.0
